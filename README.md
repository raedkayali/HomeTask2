## Project Description

This is a Java program that demonstrates a simple car management system. It defines a Car class and provides several utility methods for filtering and saving car data to text files. Here's a brief overview of the code:

- **Car Class**:
The Car class defines the attributes of a car, including ID, make, model, year, color, price, and registration number. It also has a constructor to initialize these attributes and a toString method to convert a car object to a string representation.
- **Utility Methods**:
getCarsByBrand: Filters cars by a specified brand.
getCarsByModelAndYears: Filters cars by model and years of manufacture.
getCarsByYearAndPrice: Filters cars by year and price.
saveCarsToFile: Saves a list of cars to a text file.
- **Main Method**:
The main method creates a list of sample car objects and demonstrates how to use the utility methods to filter and save car data. It includes examples of filtering by brand, model, years, and price, and saving the filtered results to text files.
